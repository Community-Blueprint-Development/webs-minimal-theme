Welcome to Community Blueprint Development Foundation!

{% include gallery %}

The Community Blueprint Development Foundation (CBDF) is an organization whose mission and vision involve expanding horizons, dreams and opportunities for at-risk YOUth. We provide education enrichment programs just for YOUth in their early years. CBDF programs are designed to enhance academic and social skills, promote self-esteem, build character, and support working parents. CBDF reassures solace for communities and its stakeholders by instilling that our YOUth are in safe and supporting environments.
