## The Community Blueprint Development Foundation (CBDF) STATEMENT OF NEEDS:

The CBDF community provides quality educational, cultural, and recreational programs and services designed Just for YOUth (ages 5-14) in a safe and structured 
environment. CBDF arranges out-of-school activities to foster student engagement. CBDF instills that programs that build positive academic, social and emotional settings allow YOUth to navigate away from negative influences and keep YOUth learning. Please help us help the families of this community and give the children somewhere safe to go and something productive to do when school is out by providing a facility with access to the following:

3-4 classrooms for instruction
Cafeteria for meals
Gym for recreation
Computer lab

Please visit Community Blueprint Development Foundation, Inc.‘s website at www.communityblueprintdevelopment.org to pledge your support.
