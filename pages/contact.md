## PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:

CBDF believes we would all be better served to invest in the future by investing in our YOUth. OurÂ primary focus is community development via YOUth development. 
YOUth Development is a blueprint for positive community development! We can also equip community YOUth with essential academic, civic, economic, and social life skills needed to improve the quality of life in a community and promote a productive and constructive society.

Contact Dr. Dell Byrd, Vice President at communityblueprintdevelopment@gmail.com for partnerships, collaborations or volunteer initiatives.
